									<h2>ISO 27001 Implementation Roadmap</h2>
								<p></p>

								<h5>Getting Started</h5>
									<p>Implementing an Information Security Management SYstem (ISMS) that complies with ISO 27001 can be a complex and overwhelming process.  It will involve participation from every member of the organization, from top-level management to the Finance, Human Resources, IT, and other teams.</p>
									<p>If your organization  is attempting to implement ISO 27001 simply curiousity's sake in attempt to identify risk expsoure, or your organization is intending to achieve an accredited certification to develop business relationships, the entire process can is made even more difficult due to the nuances of the ISO audit requirements and how they apply to your organization's specific circumstances.  Failure to properly understand how one particular requirement shouyld be applied can have significantly deleterious impacts on certification, up to audit failures and business losses.</p>
									<p>Thusly, how the organization approaches ISO 27001 implementation is entirely contingent on experienced expertise that understands the process and is innately familiar with the ISO Standard itself. </p>
								<h5>A typical ISO 27001 implementation project</h5>
									<p>First off and, most importantly, there are no 2 projects that are the same.  This is is for many reasons, such as organ izational complexity, it's existing posture of information security, the level of information security awareness, etc. </p>
									<p>FireClave offers a variety of services beginning from a preliminary organizational self-assessment to a comprehensivley applied  process with the end-result of an ISO 27001 certification.
									</p>
									<p>That said, generally, the implementation process would include </p><li>Gap Analysis: Broadly identifies organizational degree of  risk expsoure. </li>
									<li>Determination of project scope and objectives</li>
									<li>Detailed risk ssessment identification which assesses each risk and evaluates the degree of organizational exposure.</li>
									<li>Building a risk response plan that incorporates the identifiedcontrol measures that either mitigates risk expsoure elements or accepts it.  </li><li>Drafting and publishing a Risk Treatment Plan and the accompanying Statement of Applicability which highlights and discusses each risk exposure selection, mitigation, and provides an explanation for each risk expsoure element that is excluded from mitigation.</li><li>Authoring the series of mandatory ISO 27001 documents which includes individually relevant policies, procedures, and plans.</li><li>Certiciation audit preparation.</li>
									<li>Executing a process of PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT workflows that uses the concept of continuous improvement and regular reviews of the organization's adopted ISMS.</li>
								<h5>Why use an accredited certification auditing organization</h5>
									<p>Organizations who present themselves as an officially accredited certification body will be able to provide your organization with its certificate of compliance as defined by the International Standards Organization, which is the body that lays out the requirements for the auditing and certification of information security management systems. </p>
								<h5>The certification process</h5>
									<p>FireCLave will first review all of your requisite documentation, such as your ISMS and its scope, risk assessment and mitigation documents, along with your Statement of Applicability.  FireClave will then examine your organizaiton's implementation of control measures from Annex A of ISO 27001.  A site audit will be conducted, with interviewing your employees to ascertain what information security procedures are in place and actually in practice.  Once satisified, FireClave will issue your ISO 27001 certificate. </p>
								<h5>Ongoing support, maintenance, review and continuous improvement cycle</h5>
									<p>Whether or not your organization achieves certification or whether your organization is going through the exercise of leveraging ISO 27001 to self-identify audit issues,  ISO 27001 requires that you continually review your ISMS and all information security policies, procedures and practices.  Failure to do so renders the process useless.
									</p>
									<p>FireClave can offerongoing support in several ways, to include:
									<li>Independent ISMS reviews designed to illustrate additiona corrective measures, document and information security risk reviews.</li><li>FireClave will conduct internl audits that will check what controls are in place, whether they are working as expected and provide expertise on what improevement measures should be implemented </li><li>FireClave will make available its auditors to answer any questions that may be posed by other external 3rd-parfty auditors.</li></p>
